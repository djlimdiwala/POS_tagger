In POS tagging, encountering the unknown words are very common. NOUNs or VERBs are open class so they keep being created. So, we have to deal with them when they are not in corpus. To achieve high accuracy, unknown words have to be handled properly. 
I have used morphology. Morphology is the most important source of information of words. Words ending with -ed are most likely to be past participles. Words ending with -s are most likely to be plural nouns.

My approach
-----------
I have counted counts last four letters of every word. i.e. count that particular letter comes at particular position given tag t. 
Consider the following formulas




When an unknown word comes in test data, these four counts are found following value is calculated.



This value is used instead of emission probabilties.
